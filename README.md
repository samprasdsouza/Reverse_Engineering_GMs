## Prerequisites

- PyTorch 1.5.0
- Numpy 1.14.2
- Scikit-learn 0.22.2

## Getting Started

## Datasets
For reverse enginnering: 
- Download the dataset for 116 Generative models from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bAmC_9aMkWJB_scGvOOWvNeLa9FBoMUr/view?usp=sharing
- For leave out experiment, put the training data in train folder and leave out models data in test folder
- For testing on custom images, put the data in test folder.

For deepfake detection:
- Download the CelebA/LSUN dataset

For image_attribution:
- Generate 110,000 images for four different GAN models as specified in https://github.com/ningyu1991/GANFingerprints/
- For real images, use 110,000 of CelebA dataset.
- For training: we used 100,000 images and remaining 10,000 for testing.

## Training
- Provide the train and test path in respective codes as sepecified below. 
- Provide the model path to resume training
- Run the code

For reverse engineering, run:
```
python reverse_eng.py
```

For deepfake detection, run: 
```
python deepfake_detection.py
```

For image attribution, run:
```
python image_attribution.py
```

## Testing using pre-trained models
- Provide the test path in respective codes as sepecified below
- Download the pre-trained models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bzh9Pvr7L-NyQ2Mk-TBSlSq4TkMn2anB?usp=sharing
- Provide the model path in the code
- Run the code

For reverse engineering, run:
```
python reverse_eng_test.py
```
For deepfake detection, run: 
```
python deepfake_detection_test.py
```
For image attribution, run: 
```
python image_attribution_test.py
```
